#'Create a league table
#'
#'Create a league table from individually defined criteria from a results dataset.
#'
#'Mandatory parameters are a dataset with match results as well the names of the variables for home and away team and their respective scored goals.
#'
#'Optional parameters are the point distribution that will be awarded (win, draw, lose), the order of ranking criteria to use (Pts = Points, GD = Goal difference, GF = Goals for),
#'the display of additional columns with separate home and away tables and the dates and matchdays to be used for calculation.
#'
#'If a date range and a matchday range are set, the subset of matches that fit both selection criteria will be used for calculation.

#'@param dataset A dataset with the results.
#'@param home The name of the home team column in the dataset as a character string.
#'@param away The name of the away team column in the dataset  as a character string.
#'@param score_home The name of the home team goals column in the dataset as a character string.
#'@param score_away The name of the away team goals column in the dataset as a character string.
#'@param date The name of the date column in the dataset as a character string (optional).
#'@param date_start The earliest date to include if not the earliest date in the dataset as a character string in the format "YY-mm-dd" (optional).
#'@param date_end The last date to include if not the last date in the dataset as character string in the format "YY-mm-dd" (optional).
#'@param matchday The name of the matchday column in the dataset as a character string (optional).
#'@param matchday_start The earliest matchday to include if not the earliest in the dataset as an integer (optional).
#'@param matchday_end The last matchday to include if not the last in the dataset as an integer (optional).
#'@param points A vector of integers of length three containing the points awarded for wins, draws and losses. Defaults to c(3,1,0).
#'@param HA_table Logical value to indicate, whether home and away results should be displayed in the table. Defaults to FALSE.
#'@param rank_by A character vector with the order of arguments to sort the league table. Possible arguments are "Pts", "GD", "GF", "GA", "W","D","L", Defaults to c("Pts","GD","GF").
#'@return A data frame in the form of a league table.
